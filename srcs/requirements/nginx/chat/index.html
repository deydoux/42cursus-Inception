		<div class="message">
			Cows do not lay eggs. Cows are mammals, which means they give birth to live young instead of laying eggs like birds. Female cows have a reproductive system that includes a uterus, ovaries, and a placenta, where their developing calves grow and receive nutrients.<br>
			<br>
			Birds, on the other hand, have a reproductive system specifically designed for laying eggs. The female bird has ovaries that produce eggs, which are then laid through a process called oviposition.<br>
			<br>
			So, to clarify, cows do not lay eggs. If you're thinking of an animal that lays eggs, it's likely a bird or another type of egg-laying creature.<br>
