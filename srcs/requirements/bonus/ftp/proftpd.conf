# This is a basic ProFTPD configuration file (rename it to
# 'proftpd.conf' for actual use.  It establishes a single server
# and a single anonymous login.  It assumes that you have a user/group
# "proftpd" and "ftp" for normal operation and anon.

# This is the directory where DSO modules reside
# ModulePath /usr/lib/proftpd
# Include /etc/proftpd/modules.d

# Allow only user root to load and unload modules, but allow everyone
# to see which modules have been loaded
# ModuleControlsACLs insmod,rmmod allow user root
# ModuleControlsACLs lsmod allow user *

# ServerType			standalone
#DefaultServer			on

# Umask 022 is a good standard umask to prevent new dirs and files
# from being group and world writable.
# Umask				022

# To prevent DoS attacks, set the maximum number of child processes
# to 30.  If you need to allow more than 30 concurrent connections
# at once, simply increase this value.  Note that this ONLY works
# in standalone mode, in inetd mode you should use an inetd server
# that allows you to limit maximum number of processes per service
# (such as xinetd).
# MaxInstances			30

# Set the user and group under which the server will run.
